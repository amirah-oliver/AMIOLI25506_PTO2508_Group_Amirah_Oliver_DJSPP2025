# Podcast App (React)

A polished podcast discovery and listening app built with **React**, **Vite**, and **React Router**. The app allows users to browse shows from a public podcast 

## 📖 Overview

This project extends the podcast app developed during the DJS course and focuses on building a more production-ready experience.

It includes:
- a searchable and filterable home page
- a dynamic show detail view
- a global audio player that stays available across routes
- persistent favorites using `localStorage`
- light/dark theme support
- Vercel deployment with SPA route handling

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement a global audio player with full playback control
- Add support for favoriting episodes with persistent storage
- Introduce a recommended shows carousel on the landing page
- Support theme toggling for light and dark mode
- Ensure robust routing and professional deployment on Vercel

## 💾 State Management & Persistence

The app uses React Context for shared state:

- `PodcastContext` manages podcast data, filters, sorting, pagination, and favorites
- `AudioPlayerContext` manages global playback, episode queueing, and the leave-page warning while audio is active

Persistent browser storage is used for:
- saved theme preference
- favorite episodes

---

## ☁️ Deployment

The application is deployed on **Vercel**.

Because the app uses `BrowserRouter`, SPA routing fallback is required so direct visits to dynamic routes continue to work after deployment. This is handled in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
